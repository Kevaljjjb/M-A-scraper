The bulk of its contracts are municipal projects, such as K-12 Schools, Universities, Hospitals, and Government Agencies. With its specialized equipment and experienced teams, this business is able to take on projects that would be too large or too difficult for other contractors. The company’s customers are loyal, and since larger public projects and public works are rarely affected by economic changes, the business has been able to weather economic changes and continue to grow while other contractors have failed.
 The business boasts over $10M in hard assets and equipment, including 36 concrete pumps, making them one of the largest concrete companies in the nation. Moreover, the current owners have been efficient in their operations and have focused on sustainable and responsible growth. The owners approach this in two important ways: (1) They purchase all new equipment without incurring any long-term debt, and (2) The owners import their replacement parts from producers and wholesalers worldwide, which allows them to save 30-45% off what their competitors have to pay. Using these approaches, the company has over $2M in accounts receivable and ongoing work, and typically over 90% of AR is paid within 90 days. All this while remaining DEBT FREE!
 Well-trained managers and project leads are in place and the supporting administrative staff is knowledgeable and capable to handle day-to-day operations. A lot of new equipment was purchased in 2016 & 2017; generally, CapEx is less than $150,000/year.
 The owner is involved in daily operations as a manager and in an oversight capacity, and he is willing to stay on as president for 3-4 years. This is an excellent opportunity for any buyer, regardless of construction experience, as Seller will give you all the tools to succeed. Truly a turnkey business opportunity.
