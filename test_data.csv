B2B Direct Plumbing Company with 59 million in WIP,Sacramento, California,N/A,https://thefirmadv.com/Listing/B2B-Direct-Plumbing-Company-with-59-million-in-WIP-For-Sale,Maintenance/Service/Trades,thefirmadv.com,"A very unique plumbing company that specifically works with general contractors and land developers who are neighborhood production builders. There is work in progress of over $59 million dollars, plus a strong backlog. This non-union plumbing company has 98 employees on staff, including 8 in leadership and administration roles, with the other 90 as plumbers and field technicians. The client is never the end user or a home owner, it is 100% B2B. Also, this business does not provide any service or maintenance work, though that could be a great growth opportunity. The business services a 60-mile radius around Sacramento, California with 6 top annually repeating clients. Included in the purchase is working capital of $1M, along with $1.6M in equipment, vehicles, and improvements. The owner is selling due to age and retirement, though they owner is semi-passive already, providing only light oversight as needed and providing payroll. Their position would not need to have any replacement.
Priced at $12,500,000, a 10% down payment of $1,250,000 will return $1,338,637 in the first year after debt payments. This shows a huge return on investment! The owner is also willing to hold 15% of the price as either a seller carry or equity roll, or a combination thereof, showing a vested interest in the ongoing success of the company after closing. There are several growth opportunities, including expanding into service & maintenance work, and targeting more apartment complexes for commercial projects. This presents an opportunity for potential buyers who are interested in acquiring an established plumbing business with an incredible team on board and that shows significant growth potential.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$12,500,000","$19,758,164","$4,870,431",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024
