To IoT Connectivity Providers: If you appreciate that your abundant IoT Connectivity is ""just a means to an end"" you believe in the industry's need to transition to Edge of Cloud Computing, 

Description of BluEdge's Capabilities:

A. Leverages ML and AI via continuous and unsupervised reinforcement learning of networks’ smart components. 
B. Minimal need for infrastructure; smart devices (nodes of the network) can instantly route via each other via the use of swarm intelligence (a BluEdge patent). 
C. Leverage & Augment Existing Networks. 
D. Route without internet and to the internet including Mobile devices, thus creating continuous network Connectivity. 
C. Overall BluEdge enables smart devices (even with a small CPU capacity) to engage into instantaneous Ad-Hoc, scalable multi-device networks to self-organize and act in concert via an embedded API and enabled by Digital Pheromones (a BluEdge patent). 

BluEdge is now available to users of Edge Computing, Industry 4.0’s Clouds and IoT service providers. BluEdge (technology's code name) has Software Delivering Capabilities (e.g. continuous & unsupervised ML/ AI, leverage self-organization smart devices enabled by digital pheromones, etc.) via customizable Application Programming Interfaces (API/s) that can leverage your hardware and software shortcomings.


The Asking Price is based is a multiple of the funding spent for the development and testing of this advanced technology by Government and private funding.


A former senior technology official who participated in the funding, testing and development & utilization of BluEdge described it in his commendation letter as follows: ""The use of SWARM as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Swarm.2.IoT.edge company patented technologies brings a new dimension in the form of learning and enabling the creation of distributed networks capable of truly “self-forming” and “self-healing” aspects. BluEedge’s edge cutting edge solutions lend themselves to solving virtually most all of the Internet of Things (IoT) (from Bluetooth beacons to networked medical instruments, smartphones, car 2 car comm. et. al) by decreasing burdening network data schemes and the need for use mobile ad hoc networking with integrated intelligence to learn and make group decisions. In addition, the swarm proximity location learning and updates brings valuable tools to distributed intelligence.""


BluEdge is a next-generation software architecture capable of acting as the “Intelligence Layer” that enables ad-hoc, scalable multi-device networks to self-organize and act in concert. BluEdge fills this growing technological void since there are no existing architectures, protocols, API’s or algorithms that act as the ‘intelligence layer’ to enable Swarming Networks to operate as intended. The BluEdge software architecture has a clear focus on edge-based collective awareness/sharing for reinforced learning, ‘always-on’ connectivity, and complete self-governance.


In essence, BluEdge allows multi-device deployments to seamlessly share information, learn and adapt collectively via self-forming/healing networks. This creates Intelligent Networks, such as large-scale IoT deployments, capable of acting like swarms found in nature. Such capabilities enable swarms to find food, wage wars and survive.

Patented Universal Tumor Targeting Drug Delivery For Sale,Irvine,California - South,US,https://us.businessesforsale.com/us/patented-universal-tumor-targeting-drug-delivery-for-sale.aspx,N/A,businessesforsale.com,"Patented Universal Tumor-Targeting Drug Delivery Platform Co.

This pharmaceutical company has developed and patented a universal tumor-targeting drug-delivery platform that can improve the safety and efficacy of many existing chemo treatments, with the ability to target numerous different types of cancer. The technology encapsulates existing FDA-approved drugs inside lipid nanoparticles (liposomes or emulsions) coated with patented human-sourced antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The lipid nanoparticle provides long-term storage stability of the drug and controlled release of the drug over time at body-temperature, and is expected to improve the safety and efficacy profile of the drug, including passive accumulation at the tumor while not harming normal tissues. The Company’s ANA, sourced from lupus patients, binds to nuclear material present in abundance in areas of necrosis (dead / ruptured cells) present in and around all solid tumors, thus anchoring the drug-filled nanoparticles at the tumor where the nanoparticle is designed to slowly release the drug directly on the tumor for more effect. As the Company’s ANA is not tumor-marker specific, but rather targets necrosis present in solid tumors, the technology is designed to ""universally"" target many different types of cancer including breast cancer, lung, ovarian, colon, prostate, etc., as well as rare childhood cancers. 

The Company completed a successful proof-of-concept study at Children's Hospital using Ewing's Sarcoma transplanted in immunodeficient mice. Treatment with the Company's forumlation significantly inhibited tumor growth and extended survival times compared to control mice receiving no treatment or treatment with plain liposomal doxorubicin.


The Company has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA on 2 of the lead drug formulations, providing FDA fee waivers, priority review, and 7-years exclusivity upon market approval. The orphan pathway also enables the potential for New Drug Approval after successful completion of Phase 2 studies, with Phase III data collected while in the market, thus significantly lowering the time and cost to market approval. This same drug inside the Company's tumor targeting delivery system will likely have potential to treat other pediatric cancers, and/or cancers in larger adult populations.


As the Company’s platform and ANA has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of many existing FDA approved drugs or even compounds in development, the Company anticipates the potential for multiple licensing agreements with multiple pharmaceutical companies seeking to improve their existing portfolio and extend patient life as they advance into clinical stage. And as it may be possible to file for New Drug Approval following successful Phase II studies, the Company anticipates licensing potential at early clinical stage. Multiple exit opportunities exist with high impact & high ROI.


The Company is seeking a supportive capital partner to maintain momentum up to $20M. Funding will be used to advance the lead drug through formal Investigational New Drug enabling studies towards New Drug Approval; estimating $3-5 Million now to advance into clinical studies. Preclinical / animal studies estimate ($3 - 5 Million and 12-18 months); follwed by potential combined Phase I-II clinical study in a rare cancer (approximately 2-3 years and $10M) to potential New Drug Approval, plus additional capital to advance additional drugs in the pipeline simultaneously, thus adding tremendous value to the Company’s valuation. Valuations of pharma companies often exceed $100 Million valuation at Phase I (approx. 18 months), and New Drug Approval can exceed valuations above $1 Billion. The Company has numerous, improved high-impact cancer drugs advancing with proper support.

 Innovative Oil and Natural Gas Production Business,None Given,San Juan County,N/A,https://www.bizben.com/business-for-sale/innovative-oil-and-natural-gas-production-business-for-sale-in-san-juan-county-new-mexico-281294.php,N/A,Bizben.com,"Innovative Oil and Natural Gas Production Company for Sale serving New Mexico and Colorado. After completing an exit plan that liquidated a majority of its natural gas service business, this company decided to dive deeply into the production end of the business. Their specialty was taking over poor-producing wells that were unprofitable for other Producers and turning them into efficiently producing wells.

In 2017 the Company had about 12 producing wells that they owned the right to maintain. In 2018, 2019, and 2020 they expanded aggressively which brought them up to approximately 236 conventional wells, 1 private injection well, and 1 commercial injection well in New Mexico in addition to 4 wells in Colorado.

The company has focused on underdeveloped and neglected ""end of life"" wells that just need to be operated properly. This company has the ability to make an efficient well out of an inefficient well. This is due to their technology that monitors these wells on a 24-hour and 7-day-a-week basis and provides wireless technology monitoring. Production printouts are available and will be provided on request.

Most wells come from larger production companies that have higher overhead and consider the wells marginal. With lower overhead and proper maintenance, these wells are still viable and will be for another 20 years. The majority of the wells they operate are what are called ""wellbore only"" meaning they only have rights in the existing formation of said well and no rights to drill or recomplete in any other formation. This is where the sharing of leases comes in, where other companies will have rights in drilling or operating different formations than they do on the same physical lease.  That means different depths and different formations, but on the same land. It can get a bit complicated for those that drill and form leases.  They have decided to stay out of that space and focused on just maintaining and operating existing wells and infrastructure.  Of course, a new Buyer will have additional options for expansion.

A great opportunity for growth exists since more wells are available for acquisition.  Current owners have turned down recent well-acquisition prospects due to the want for further growth.  These opportunities would be available to new owners should they choose to take them. Another area of opportunity is when Operators request services from them on a regular basis.  Current owners turn down the work to focus on internal operations.  These opportunities would be available to the new owners should they choose to take them.  This type of work would be similar to what employees and equipment are already doing internally, but as a contractor instead, bringing in more revenue using existing equipment and infrastructure.

REAL ESTATE: Real Estate can potentially be included in this deal at the right price. They own 2 buildings both in New Mexico. The first building has a little over 10,000 sq ft of industrial space with 1,500 sq ft of office mezzanine space included. The second Building has a little over 1,700 sq ft and is used as a utility shed and storage.

EQUIPMENT: The equipment list includes major operations equipment only and does not include equipment on location, spare tanks, pumping units, misc. yard equipment such as pipe racks, shelving, bulk fluid tanks, truck tools, inventory, etc.

EMPLOYEES: There are 25 employees in this company including the Seller who is the President of the company. They comprise 1 Workover Supervisor and 1 Rig Operator and 4 Rig workers, 2 CDL Drivers, 1 CDL Crane Operator, 3 Office workers including the Seller who does Payroll, HR, and Owner relations, 1 Head of Operations, and 5 Operations/Mechanics, 1 Software Developer and 1 Automation/Electrical Operations, 1 Welder/Fabrication, 1 General Operations worker, 1 Operation/Heavy Haul, 1 Shop Mechanic

The Oil Drilling and Gas Extraction Industry includes companies that profit from extracting and selling fossil fuels. Producers have experienced a high degree of volatility in recent years. Steady growth was ripped away when COVID-19 halted the economy, as restrictions limited the need for oil and gas. The conflict in Ukraine added to the uncertainty, as the reliance on Russian oil and gas was distributed between domestic producers and other sources.

Although, as the economy recovered demand shot up quicker than supply could match, causing prices to surge and generate substantial returns. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 10.6% to $737.3 billion over the past five years, despite a drop of 7.9% in 2023 alone as the supply chain normalizes.

Exports of crude oil and natural gas from the United States had long been banned with few exceptions, but legislation passed in 2016 overturned this rule and dramatically changed the industry. Exports increased dramatically as producers sought to capitalize on opportunities abroad, while imports remained relatively steady.  This led to an increase in the prices of oil and gas domestically until the pandemic hit. Exports have continued to grow in recent years, becoming essential to success in the industry. 

As prices stabilize and global supply chains repair, revenue is expected to fall toward pre-pandemic levels, but not as rapidly as it rose. Innovation pertaining to drilling technology will drive the industry forward, but environmental concerns and increasing pressure to convert to renewables will limit success. Fossil fuel prices will decline steadily but remain high and provide high profit for producers. Overall, revenue will fall at a CAGR of 5.5% to $555.4 billion over the next five years.",N/A,Maurice J Boudreau,321-960-1320 ,N/A,"$15,000,000.00","$8,450,000.00","$1,317,605.00",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,

 American Buffet Hibachi Grill Chain - 4 Unit Chain,San Jose,San Jose,N/A,https://www.bizben.com/business-for-sale/american-buffet-hibachi-grill-chain-for-sale-in-san-jose-california-283775.php,N/A,Bizben.com,"A group of 3 experienced-based restaurants located in tourism-centric cities (with a fourth opening soon) is available for acquisition by a larger restaurant group. The concept – a convergence of an American buffet and hibachi grill – creates a personal interactive dining experience for couples, families, and large groups that brings in more than $3 million in sales per location.
The entrepreneurs were the first/prime franchisee. Years later, they acquired the original restaurant and took over the entire enterprise. Instead of offering additional franchises, each of the three open restaurants is owned by the same group of people.
What provides a huge attraction for diners of every age and a great advantage for the owners is the semi-self-serve, low-server labor matrix that comes from not having a set menu.
A fresh market of ingredients inspires hundreds of combinations of meals that cater to personal diets, and individual tastes on any given night. Cooked right in front of them and served hot off the grill.
Based on nearly 4,000 total Yelp, Open Table, and Google reviews, the public perception regarding the restaurants, their customer service, and value have been very positive, averaging more than 4 stars.
An NDA is required to secure comprehensive Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) crafted by ProNova Partners.
Detailed Information
Facilities: The four locations average 5,100 square feet each. The East Coast restaurant is the largest with more than 7,500 sq. ft.; while the mountain location is the smallest at 3,500. It and the SoCal location each have an additional 2,000 sq. ft. or more, of outside dining area. Only one lease is coming up within the next year.
Competition: This chain of restaurants stands out from typical ‘all you can eat’ (AYCE) buffet restaurants, like Fogo de Chão, where the food is prepared and cooked prior to the diner's arrival because here guests get their chosen meals cooked to order.
Although other specialty restaurant cooks in front of the guests, it is usually in a group setting with a sparse menu. Smaller, local ethnic-based restaurants come closer to the experience, but ingredient choices are limited. The customer base, however, is most similar to those of Bubba Gump and California Pizza Kitchen.
Growth & Expansion: To spur revenue, it is suggested to increase local marketing during the tourist offseason, making social media postings consistent across locations, along with increasing frequency.
Financing: TBD if the structure and terms are acceptable.
Support & Training: To ensure a smooth transition and ongoing success the Sellers will work with a buyer as needed as paid management or on-call consultants, as negotiated.
Reason for Selling: Ready to be scaled now. With capital & vision, rapid growth is highly feasible.",N/A,Rick Carlson,833-776-6682 ,N/A,"$10,000,000.00","$8,214,000.00","$816,317.00",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,

Facilities: No facilities. The staff is a fully remote, US domestic workforce.

Competition: The typical offering in this space is a niche-focused service line.

There are many companies that can effectively navigate both spaces on behalf of their clients.

Growth & Expansion: The company recently expanded its lead volume significantly.  Continued investment in sales should yield ROI in excess of 150%.   Establishing additional lead volume, particularly in its counter-cyclical business segments should provide even higher returns. The company has a history of successful acquisitions and encourages prospective Buyers to pursue continued consolidation efforts.

Financing: TBD if structure and terms are acceptable.

Established in 1982, this cabinet manufacturing company has survived the test of time. The company is being listed for sale due to the owner's desire to retire. The company had its humble beginning with its inception in the owner's garage, which has now grown to average revenues of approx. $5MM, with 2022 revenues of $5.3MM+ and anticipated SDE of $600k+.

The company manufactures precision custom-made commercial & residential cabinets & countertops using state-of-the-art technologies & controlled manufacturing environment. The company ships nationwide and does full interior remodeling locally in southern California. The company is CSLB licensed, bonded & insured.

The company is well-established and holds a great reputation for the quality of its work as well as the service it provides to its customers. Being established for over 4 decades, the company has learned with time the best practices to not only survive but to thrive in different market conditions & to manage a well-balanced customer portfolio of residential & commercial clients, and private & public works. The company prefers working as a subcontractor, hence eliminating the need to bid directly for the project. This is however an opportunity for a buyer who wishes to scale operations by directly bidding for the work or a current contractor to bring this work in-house. The company works directly with the CDC & Housing Authority.

The company maintains a full team of back & front office staff (foreman, draftsmen, scheduler, and estimator to name a few key positions) which will be of great benefit for a smooth transition. The current team can provide a great foundation for a buyer who intends to grow the business as well as a strategic buyer who can add value to their current operations by not acquiring a business, but talent as well. The owners are willing to assist with a smooth transition, with one of the owners willing to stay with the company for a relatively long period.

The type of residential projects the company performs are (but are not limited to): kitchens, vanities, entertainment, garage cabinets, and more for residential properties. As for commercial projects, the company performs jobs such as countertops, front desks, commercial buildings, hotels, government offices, medical clinics, apartments (new as well as old), etc. Some of the many low-hanging fruits that can help with growth the owners believe are an expansion of its facility, machinery, estimators, and additional employees. The business can also additionally implement a variety of other services which the owners will discuss in detail other ideas with the buyer.

The business has established systems in place that would cover everything from lead generation, designing, accounting, manufacturing as well as installing the cabinets. Due to its history and its reputation, the business has repeat customers and it generates new leads consistently.

Their client list includes general contractors, business owners, and warehouse consultants. Upon receiving an inquiry from an existing client, they visit the job site (as required) and design the fire protection solution. Once awarded the contract, the team sets up the required paperwork (permits, licenses, COIs, etc.) and orders the materials. Materials are delivered to the job site ready to install; onsite fabrication is not required. Jobs range from 1 day (for maintenance and repair) to 18 months (for larger multi-building installations), and are typically serviced by 2-4 person crews. After installation and final test, the job is complete.

25 Year Old Nutritional Supplements eCommerce Brand & Manufacturer – 50% Customer Retention – Full Control of Manufacturing Process – Proprietary Formulas,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to purchase a brand in the Nutritional Supplements space that has been in operation for over 25 years. Over the years, the company that owns this brand has worked tirelessly to develop flavors and exclusive formulas for its supplements, which are presented to the consumer in Liquid Form. Since liquid supplements are absorbed into the body at a rate of around 96%, versus roughly 18% for pill and capsule form, consumers are more interested in this product compared to the traditional pill form.
The issue for other liquid supplements brands has always been flavor. Many consumers understand the absorbative benefit in drinking their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but oftentimes cannot take the bad taste that is oftentimes present with other brands’ formulas. This company has resolved that problem and created formulas that cannot be copied by others, especially since they also own the manufacturing plant that makes all their products. With complete control of manufacturing, inventory management, and formula development, the company has withstood the test of time and become a leader on the Amazon platform for this subcategory.
This is proven by the company’s 50% Repeat Order Rate – an astounding achievement for any brand even in the consumable supplements space.
The niche market in which this brand operates reached a value of $42 billion in 2022, with projections signaling significant growth. Experts anticipate an 8% CAGR, reaching an estimated $93 billion by 2030. Several factors drive this growth, including heightened health awareness, fitness trends, and the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.
KPIs
Liquid supplements thrive in a competitive overall supplement landscape with limited rivals. The intricate manufacturing process, which this company owns and operates, and the challenge of perfecting taste, create hurdles for potential competitors, paving the way for this brand’s success. This is a huge defensive moat that cannot be overlooked by potential suitors.
As noted, the business has its own manufacturing facility. While the manufacturing arm isn’t up for sale as part of this transaction (since it also provides products for other brands), it presents considerable advantages to a potential buyer, who will receive best in class, guaranteed pricing, have the option to develop new products at super low upfront costs, and control their own destiny as it relates to inventory management. Upon acquisition, the new owner will gain control over the process, ensuring product quality and stability. Furthermore, agreed-upon product costs remain steady, guarding against unexpected price fluctuations.
Over time, management has accumulated invaluable assets like videos, testimonials, and marketing materials that can be used to more fully develop the company’s growth plan. These resources offer a platform for expanding the brand, setting the stage for significant growth.
Revenue Generation
The company embarked on its journey many years ago and has adapted consistently and shrewdly, now successfully selling products on Amazon and through a Shopify-built website. Their range encompasses diverse multivitamins and supplements targeting various health concerns, such as bone strength, weight loss, vision, brain function, and hair, skin, and nail health.
They boast a portfolio of 28 popular SKUs that are exclusively branded. Achieving an average order value of $65 across the range, no single product dominates sales. Top performers include multivitamins tailored for children, women, and men.
Sales maintain strength year-round, experiencing a spike around the New Year due to health-focused resolutions. The typical customer is a woman aged 40 or older who often orders multiple products to meet her family’s wellness needs.
While the website drives strong sales, Amazon generates 70% of revenue. Factors like efficient shipping through FBA and maintaining three months’ inventory contribute to this robust presence.
The brand’s success on Amazon is bolstered by highly positive customer reviews, fostering authenticity among potential buyers. Besides direct-to-consumer sales, approximately 10% of revenue comes from major retail distributors, a segment with promising growth due to the expanding health and beauty sectors.
Advertising & Acquisition
Marketing plays a pivotal role, which is evident from the over 16,000 unique monthly visitors to the website. Ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google complement this organic traffic.
Investment in SEO, emphasizing backlinks and a keyword-focused blog, enhances search engine rankings and website traffic. Leveraging an email database of over 60,000 subscribers aids in product promotion, and an active social media presence fosters a loyal customer community.
Efficient daily operations managed by an experienced team, including a full-time Amazon manager and two in-house sales managers, form a significant benefit for potential buyers. The current owners focus primarily on inventory management and overseeing the proficient team.
This is a unique opportunity to invest in a well-established eCommerce brand in a thriving niche—the minimal competition, manufacturing control, and influential marketing position it for future accomplishment.
The sellers are open to a flexible transaction structure, aiming to retain between 20% and 30% equity. This demonstrates their belief in the business and commitment to exponential growth with strategic partners. Their ownership of the manufacturing arm ensures continued involvement, guaranteeing smooth operations, stable pricing, and efficient order processing.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$ 15,000,000","$ 7,700,277","$ 2,460,066",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,,,https://www.websiteclosers.com/businesses/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/108496

Shapewear products have grown progressively more popular due to their ability to enhance body shape and provide a slimming effect, giving the wearer’s body a more streamlined silhouette that’s desirable among many consumers. Compression garments, meanwhile, are typically used post-surgery to expedite the healing process by providing valuable support to the treated area.
The specific combination of markets that the company serves has made them ideal for customers undergoing cosmetic procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts, liposuction, or tummy tucks, with their products helping to reduce swelling and promote faster recovery.
The company has readily tackled the surge of demand in their industry, growing into the most prominent wholesaler in the US. Though they own most of the brands they sell, they also have exclusive distribution agreements with various other popular brands, giving them a competitive edge in the market. As they source their products from Latin America, a region where specialized compression garments and shapewear are prevalent, they can successfully offer their customers authentic and high-quality products.
Their success can be further noted by their marvelous reputation on popular online platforms like Amazon, where they regularly enjoy top ranking in the Shapewear-Bodysuits category through the trust and credibility they’ve built up around their products.
Their manufacturers are primarily based in Colombia and Mexico, with each manufacturing plant having a specialized team. Management has negotiated exclusive safety stock with them, and over the past decade, many of their products have been exclusively manufactured for the company. They own the largest brands and distribute and sell some others, with many also having exclusivity contracts.
The company places their orders on a weekly and monthly basis, with favorable net 45 to 60-day payment terms.
They maintain over 60 days of sales inventory in their domestic warehouse and have the same amount hosted at Amazon FBA facilities. They also offer DropShipping for their wholesale customers, which cuts down on fulfillment costs.
They have a total of 7,000 SKUs spread out across roughly 500 products, with no concentration on any specific product. Their top 10 products are responsible for 40% of units sold, while the top 100 accounts for 83%.
The company’s wholesale channel accounts for 60% of their total revenue, with 930 active wholesale customers spending an average of $900 per order and providing the brand with both a 70% repeat purchase rate and a YOY growth rate of 15%. The remaining 40% is generated through retail, which is divided between their Amazon storefront, their company websites, Walmart, and eBay, with Amazon generating most of these sales at 67%. They have had a fantastic track record for 6 years, with each year seeing improved margins.
The brand sees little seasonality in their sales, as there is year-round demand for their products. They do, however, see a peak during March and April, which are months when plastic and cosmetic surgeries are most in demand. Management increased inventory levels by around 20% during this period.
Their digital marketing strategy consists of various tactics that differ across channels and has proven effective enough to attract over 2 million impressions every month. They use SEO, email and SMS marketing, influencers, social media ads, and PPC on search engines for their websites, and SEO, PPC, product placement, and special deals for Amazon.
They use many of the above strategies for their wholesale channels, which they complement with attending trade shows and outreach from a team of sales reps.
The company has 5 shareholders who work in the following capacities:
Nearly all the brand’s operations, logistics, app development, IMS, marketing, and content are performed in-house by various departments. Their team is incredibly seasoned and talented at what they do, with each department head having worked for the brand for an average of 6 years.

The future for the shapewear and compression garment industry is bright, with the market poised to see significant growth and demand throughout the upcoming years.

25 Year Old Nutritional Supplements eCommerce Brand & Manufacturer – 50% Customer Retention – Full Control of Manufacturing Process – Proprietary Formulas,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to purchase a brand in the Nutritional Supplements space that has been in operation for over 25 years. Over the years, the company that owns this brand has worked tirelessly to develop flavors and exclusive formulas for its supplements, which are presented to the consumer in Liquid Form. Since liquid supplements are absorbed into the body at a rate of around 96%, versus roughly 18% for pill and capsule form, consumers are more interested in this product compared to the traditional pill form.
The issue for other liquid supplements brands has always been flavor. Many consumers understand the absorbative benefit in drinking their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but oftentimes cannot take the bad taste that is oftentimes present with other brands’ formulas. This company has resolved that problem and created formulas that cannot be copied by others, especially since they also own the manufacturing plant that makes all their products. With complete control of manufacturing, inventory management, and formula development, the company has withstood the test of time and become a leader on the Amazon platform for this subcategory.
This is proven by the company’s 50% Repeat Order Rate – an astounding achievement for any brand even in the consumable supplements space.
The niche market in which this brand operates reached a value of $42 billion in 2022, with projections signaling significant growth. Experts anticipate an 8% CAGR, reaching an estimated $93 billion by 2030. Several factors drive this growth, including heightened health awareness, fitness trends, and the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.
KPIs
Liquid supplements thrive in a competitive overall supplement landscape with limited rivals. The intricate manufacturing process, which this company owns and operates, and the challenge of perfecting taste, create hurdles for potential competitors, paving the way for this brand’s success. This is a huge defensive moat that cannot be overlooked by potential suitors.
As noted, the business has its own manufacturing facility. While the manufacturing arm isn’t up for sale as part of this transaction (since it also provides products for other brands), it presents considerable advantages to a potential buyer, who will receive best in class, guaranteed pricing, have the option to develop new products at super low upfront costs, and control their own destiny as it relates to inventory management. Upon acquisition, the new owner will gain control over the process, ensuring product quality and stability. Furthermore, agreed-upon product costs remain steady, guarding against unexpected price fluctuations.
Over time, management has accumulated invaluable assets like videos, testimonials, and marketing materials that can be used to more fully develop the company’s growth plan. These resources offer a platform for expanding the brand, setting the stage for significant growth.
Revenue Generation
The company embarked on its journey many years ago and has adapted consistently and shrewdly, now successfully selling products on Amazon and through a Shopify-built website. Their range encompasses diverse multivitamins and supplements targeting various health concerns, such as bone strength, weight loss, vision, brain function, and hair, skin, and nail health.
They boast a portfolio of 28 popular SKUs that are exclusively branded. Achieving an average order value of $65 across the range, no single product dominates sales. Top performers include multivitamins tailored for children, women, and men.
Sales maintain strength year-round, experiencing a spike around the New Year due to health-focused resolutions. The typical customer is a woman aged 40 or older who often orders multiple products to meet her family’s wellness needs.
While the website drives strong sales, Amazon generates 70% of revenue. Factors like efficient shipping through FBA and maintaining three months’ inventory contribute to this robust presence.
The brand’s success on Amazon is bolstered by highly positive customer reviews, fostering authenticity among potential buyers. Besides direct-to-consumer sales, approximately 10% of revenue comes from major retail distributors, a segment with promising growth due to the expanding health and beauty sectors.

25 Year Old Nutritional Supplements eCommerce Brand & Manufacturer – 50% Customer Retention – Full Control of Manufacturing Process – Proprietary Formulas,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to purchase a brand in the Nutritional Supplements space that has been in operation for over 25 years. Over the years, the company that owns this brand has worked tirelessly to develop flavors and exclusive formulas for its supplements, which are presented to the consumer in Liquid Form. Since liquid supplements are absorbed into the body at a rate of around 96%, versus roughly 18% for pill and capsule form, consumers are more interested in this product compared to the traditional pill form.
The issue for other liquid supplements brands has always been flavor. Many consumers understand the absorbative benefit in drinking their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but oftentimes cannot take the bad taste that is oftentimes present with other brands’ formulas. This company has resolved that problem and created formulas that cannot be copied by others, especially since they also own the manufacturing plant that makes all their products. With complete control of manufacturing, inventory management, and formula development, the company has withstood the test of time and become a leader on the Amazon platform for this subcategory.
This is proven by the company’s 50% Repeat Order Rate – an astounding achievement for any brand even in the consumable supplements space.
The niche market in which this brand operates reached a value of $42 billion in 2022, with projections signaling significant growth. Experts anticipate an 8% CAGR, reaching an estimated $93 billion by 2030. Several factors drive this growth, including heightened health awareness, fitness trends, and the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.
KPIs
Liquid supplements thrive in a competitive overall supplement landscape with limited rivals. The intricate manufacturing process, which this company owns and operates, and the challenge of perfecting taste, create hurdles for potential competitors, paving the way for this brand’s success. This is a huge defensive moat that cannot be overlooked by potential suitors.
As noted, the business has its own manufacturing facility. While the manufacturing arm isn’t up for sale as part of this transaction (since it also provides products for other brands), it presents considerable advantages to a potential buyer, who will receive best in class, guaranteed pricing, have the option to develop new products at super low upfront costs, and control their own destiny as it relates to inventory management. Upon acquisition, the new owner will gain control over the process, ensuring product quality and stability. Furthermore, agreed-upon product costs remain steady, guarding against unexpected price fluctuations.
Over time, management has accumulated invaluable assets like videos, testimonials, and marketing materials that can be used to more fully develop the company’s growth plan. These resources offer a platform for expanding the brand, setting the stage for significant growth.
Revenue Generation
The company embarked on its journey many years ago and has adapted consistently and shrewdly, now successfully selling products on Amazon and through a Shopify-built website. Their range encompasses diverse multivitamins and supplements targeting various health concerns, such as bone strength, weight loss, vision, brain function, and hair, skin, and nail health.
They boast a portfolio of 28 popular SKUs that are exclusively branded. Achieving an average order value of $65 across the range, no single product dominates sales. Top performers include multivitamins tailored for children, women, and men.
Sales maintain strength year-round, experiencing a spike around the New Year due to health-focused resolutions. The typical customer is a woman aged 40 or older who often orders multiple products to meet her family’s wellness needs.
While the website drives strong sales, Amazon generates 70% of revenue. Factors like efficient shipping through FBA and maintaining three months’ inventory contribute to this robust presence.
The brand’s success on Amazon is bolstered by highly positive customer reviews, fostering authenticity among potential buyers. Besides direct-to-consumer sales, approximately 10% of revenue comes from major retail distributors, a segment with promising growth due to the expanding health and beauty sectors.
Advertising & Acquisition
Marketing plays a pivotal role, which is evident from the over 16,000 unique monthly visitors to the website. Ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google complement this organic traffic.
Investment in SEO, emphasizing backlinks and a keyword-focused blog, enhances search engine rankings and website traffic. Leveraging an email database of over 60,000 subscribers aids in product promotion, and an active social media presence fosters a loyal customer community.
Efficient daily operations managed by an experienced team, including a full-time Amazon manager and two in-house sales managers, form a significant benefit for potential buyers. The current owners focus primarily on inventory management and overseeing the proficient team.
This is a unique opportunity to invest in a well-established eCommerce brand in a thriving niche—the minimal competition, manufacturing control, and influential marketing position it for future accomplishment.
The sellers are open to a flexible transaction structure, aiming to retain between 20% and 30% equity. This demonstrates their belief in the business and commitment to exponential growth with strategic partners. Their ownership of the manufacturing arm ensures continued involvement, guaranteeing smooth operations, stable pricing, and efficient order processing.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$ 15,000,000","$ 7,700,277","$ 2,460,066",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,,,https://www.websiteclosers.com/businesses/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/108496
Medical Compression & Women’s Shapewear Brand – eCommerce & Wholesale Channels – 70% Repeat Wholesale Orders – 31% Repeat Retail Orders,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/medical-compression-womens-shapewear-brand-ecommerce-wholesale-channels-70-repeat-wholesale-orders-31-repeat-retail-orders/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a highly regarded eCommerce leader in the shapewear and compression garment industry, that has, due to a rise of interest in the North American region, found a particularly strong foothold in the United States.
Shapewear products have grown progressively more popular due to their ability to enhance body shape and provide a slimming effect, giving the wearer’s body a more streamlined silhouette that’s desirable among many consumers. Compression garments, meanwhile, are typically used post-surgery to expedite the healing process by providing valuable support to the treated area.
The specific combination of markets that the company serves has made them ideal for customers undergoing cosmetic procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts, liposuction, or tummy tucks, with their products helping to reduce swelling and promote faster recovery.
The company has readily tackled the surge of demand in their industry, growing into the most prominent wholesaler in the US. Though they own most of the brands they sell, they also have exclusive distribution agreements with various other popular brands, giving them a competitive edge in the market. As they source their products from Latin America, a region where specialized compression garments and shapewear are prevalent, they can successfully offer their customers authentic and high-quality products.
Their success can be further noted by their marvelous reputation on popular online platforms like Amazon, where they regularly enjoy top ranking in the Shapewear-Bodysuits category through the trust and credibility they’ve built up around their products.
Their manufacturers are primarily based in Colombia and Mexico, with each manufacturing plant having a specialized team. Management has negotiated exclusive safety stock with them, and over the past decade, many of their products have been exclusively manufactured for the company. They own the largest brands and distribute and sell some others, with many also having exclusivity contracts.
The company places their orders on a weekly and monthly basis, with favorable net 45 to 60-day payment terms.
They maintain over 60 days of sales inventory in their domestic warehouse and have the same amount hosted at Amazon FBA facilities. They also offer DropShipping for their wholesale customers, which cuts down on fulfillment costs.
They have a total of 7,000 SKUs spread out across roughly 500 products, with no concentration on any specific product. Their top 10 products are responsible for 40% of units sold, while the top 100 accounts for 83%.
The company’s wholesale channel accounts for 60% of their total revenue, with 930 active wholesale customers spending an average of $900 per order and providing the brand with both a 70% repeat purchase rate and a YOY growth rate of 15%. The remaining 40% is generated through retail, which is divided between their Amazon storefront, their company websites, Walmart, and eBay, with Amazon generating most of these sales at 67%. They have had a fantastic track record for 6 years, with each year seeing improved margins.
The brand sees little seasonality in their sales, as there is year-round demand for their products. They do, however, see a peak during March and April, which are months when plastic and cosmetic surgeries are most in demand. Management increased inventory levels by around 20% during this period.
Their digital marketing strategy consists of various tactics that differ across channels and has proven effective enough to attract over 2 million impressions every month. They use SEO, email and SMS marketing, influencers, social media ads, and PPC on search engines for their websites, and SEO, PPC, product placement, and special deals for Amazon.
They use many of the above strategies for their wholesale channels, which they complement with attending trade shows and outreach from a team of sales reps.
The company has 5 shareholders who work in the following capacities:
Nearly all the brand’s operations, logistics, app development, IMS, marketing, and content are performed in-house by various departments. Their team is incredibly seasoned and talented at what they do, with each department head having worked for the brand for an average of 6 years. They boast a great company culture, which is reflected in their exceedingly low turnover of critical personnel by industry standards.
The future for the shapewear and compression garment industry is bright, with the market poised to see significant growth and demand throughout the upcoming years.

25 Year Old Nutritional Supplements eCommerce Brand & Manufacturer – 50% Customer Retention – Full Control of Manufacturing Process – Proprietary Formulas,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to purchase a brand in the Nutritional Supplements space that has been in operation for over 25 years. Over the years, the company that owns this brand has worked tirelessly to develop flavors and exclusive formulas for its supplements, which are presented to the consumer in Liquid Form. Since liquid supplements are absorbed into the body at a rate of around 96%, versus roughly 18% for pill and capsule form, consumers are more interested in this product compared to the traditional pill form.
The issue for other liquid supplements brands has always been flavor. Many consumers understand the absorbative benefit in drinking their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but oftentimes cannot take the bad taste that is oftentimes present with other brands’ formulas. This company has resolved that problem and created formulas that cannot be copied by others, especially since they also own the manufacturing plant that makes all their products. With complete control of manufacturing, inventory management, and formula development, the company has withstood the test of time and become a leader on the Amazon platform for this subcategory.
This is proven by the company’s 50% Repeat Order Rate – an astounding achievement for any brand even in the consumable supplements space.
The niche market in which this brand operates reached a value of $42 billion in 2022, with projections signaling significant growth. Experts anticipate an 8% CAGR, reaching an estimated $93 billion by 2030. Several factors drive this growth, including heightened health awareness, fitness trends, and the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.
KPIs
Liquid supplements thrive in a competitive overall supplement landscape with limited rivals. The intricate manufacturing process, which this company owns and operates, and the challenge of perfecting taste, create hurdles for potential competitors, paving the way for this brand’s success. This is a huge defensive moat that cannot be overlooked by potential suitors.
As noted, the business has its own manufacturing facility. While the manufacturing arm isn’t up for sale as part of this transaction (since it also provides products for other brands), it presents considerable advantages to a potential buyer, who will receive best in class, guaranteed pricing, have the option to develop new products at super low upfront costs, and control their own destiny as it relates to inventory management. Upon acquisition, the new owner will gain control over the process, ensuring product quality and stability. Furthermore, agreed-upon product costs remain steady, guarding against unexpected price fluctuations.
Over time, management has accumulated invaluable assets like videos, testimonials, and marketing materials that can be used to more fully develop the company’s growth plan. These resources offer a platform for expanding the brand, setting the stage for significant growth.
Revenue Generation
The company embarked on its journey many years ago and has adapted consistently and shrewdly, now successfully selling products on Amazon and through a Shopify-built website. Their range encompasses diverse multivitamins and supplements targeting various health concerns, such as bone strength, weight loss, vision, brain function, and hair, skin, and nail health.
They boast a portfolio of 28 popular SKUs that are exclusively branded. Achieving an average order value of $65 across the range, no single product dominates sales. Top performers include multivitamins tailored for children, women, and men.
Sales maintain strength year-round, experiencing a spike around the New Year due to health-focused resolutions. The typical customer is a woman aged 40 or older who often orders multiple products to meet her family’s wellness needs.
While the website drives strong sales, Amazon generates 70% of revenue. Factors like efficient shipping through FBA and maintaining three months’ inventory contribute to this robust presence.
The brand’s success on Amazon is bolstered by highly positive customer reviews, fostering authenticity among potential buyers. Besides direct-to-consumer sales, approximately 10% of revenue comes from major retail distributors, a segment with promising growth due to the expanding health and beauty sectors.
Advertising & Acquisition
Marketing plays a pivotal role, which is evident from the over 16,000 unique monthly visitors to the website. Ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google complement this organic traffic.
Investment in SEO, emphasizing backlinks and a keyword-focused blog, enhances search engine rankings and website traffic. Leveraging an email database of over 60,000 subscribers aids in product promotion, and an active social media presence fosters a loyal customer community.
Efficient daily operations managed by an experienced team, including a full-time Amazon manager and two in-house sales managers, form a significant benefit for potential buyers. The current owners focus primarily on inventory management and overseeing the proficient team.
This is a unique opportunity to invest in a well-established eCommerce brand in a thriving niche—the minimal competition, manufacturing control, and influential marketing position it for future accomplishment.
The sellers are open to a flexible transaction structure, aiming to retain between 20% and 30% equity. This demonstrates their belief in the business and commitment to exponential growth with strategic partners. Their ownership of the manufacturing arm ensures continued involvement, guaranteeing smooth operations, stable pricing, and efficient order processing.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$ 15,000,000","$ 7,700,277","$ 2,460,066",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,,,https://www.websiteclosers.com/businesses/25-year-old-nutritional-supplements-ecommerce-brand-manufacturer-50-customer-retention-full-control-of-manufacturing-process-proprietary-formulas/108496
Medical Compression & Women’s Shapewear Brand – eCommerce & Wholesale Channels – 70% Repeat Wholesale Orders – 31% Repeat Retail Orders,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/medical-compression-womens-shapewear-brand-ecommerce-wholesale-channels-70-repeat-wholesale-orders-31-repeat-retail-orders/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a highly regarded eCommerce leader in the shapewear and compression garment industry, that has, due to a rise of interest in the North American region, found a particularly strong foothold in the United States.
Shapewear products have grown progressively more popular due to their ability to enhance body shape and provide a slimming effect, giving the wearer’s body a more streamlined silhouette that’s desirable among many consumers. Compression garments, meanwhile, are typically used post-surgery to expedite the healing process by providing valuable support to the treated area.
The specific combination of markets that the company serves has made them ideal for customers undergoing cosmetic procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts, liposuction, or tummy tucks, with their products helping to reduce swelling and promote faster recovery.
The company has readily tackled the surge of demand in their industry, growing into the most prominent wholesaler in the US. Though they own most of the brands they sell, they also have exclusive distribution agreements with various other popular brands, giving them a competitive edge in the market. As they source their products from Latin America, a region where specialized compression garments and shapewear are prevalent, they can successfully offer their customers authentic and high-quality products.
Their success can be further noted by their marvelous reputation on popular online platforms like Amazon, where they regularly enjoy top ranking in the Shapewear-Bodysuits category through the trust and credibility they’ve built up around their products.
Their manufacturers are primarily based in Colombia and Mexico, with each manufacturing plant having a specialized team. Management has negotiated exclusive safety stock with them, and over the past decade, many of their products have been exclusively manufactured for the company. They own the largest brands and distribute and sell some others, with many also having exclusivity contracts.
The company places their orders on a weekly and monthly basis, with favorable net 45 to 60-day payment terms.
They maintain over 60 days of sales inventory in their domestic warehouse and have the same amount hosted at Amazon FBA facilities. They also offer DropShipping for their wholesale customers, which cuts down on fulfillment costs.
They have a total of 7,000 SKUs spread out across roughly 500 products, with no concentration on any specific product. Their top 10 products are responsible for 40% of units sold, while the top 100 accounts for 83%.
The company’s wholesale channel accounts for 60% of their total revenue, with 930 active wholesale customers spending an average of $900 per order and providing the brand with both a 70% repeat purchase rate and a YOY growth rate of 15%. The remaining 40% is generated through retail, which is divided between their Amazon storefront, their company websites, Walmart, and eBay, with Amazon generating most of these sales at 67%. They have had a fantastic track record for 6 years, with each year seeing improved margins.
The brand sees little seasonality in their sales, as there is year-round demand for their products. They do, however, see a peak during March and April, which are months when plastic and cosmetic surgeries are most in demand. Management increased inventory levels by around 20% during this period.
Their digital marketing strategy consists of various tactics that differ across channels and has proven effective enough to attract over 2 million impressions every month. They use SEO, email and SMS marketing, influencers, social media ads, and PPC on search engines for their websites, and SEO, PPC, product placement, and special deals for Amazon.
They use many of the above strategies for their wholesale channels, which they complement with attending trade shows and outreach from a team of sales reps.
The company has 5 shareholders who work in the following capacities:
Nearly all the brand’s operations, logistics, app development, IMS, marketing, and content are performed in-house by various departments. Their team is incredibly seasoned and talented at what they do, with each department head having worked for the brand for an average of 6 years. They boast a great company culture, which is reflected in their exceedingly low turnover of critical personnel by industry standards.
The future for the shapewear and compression garment industry is bright, with the market poised to see significant growth and demand throughout the upcoming years. The products in this industry are progressively becoming more comfortable, versatile, and aesthetically appealing as fabric technology, design innovation, and focus on health & wellness marches on, fueling interest and sales.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$ 27,765,000","$ 48,845,843","$ 5,841,837",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,,,https://www.websiteclosers.com/businesses/medical-compression-women-s-shapewear-brand-ecommerce-wholesale-channels-70-repeat-wholesale-orders-31-repeat-retail-orders/108512

Marketing plays a pivotal role, which is evident from the over 16,000 unique monthly visitors to the website. Ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google complement this organic traffic.
Investment in SEO, emphasizing backlinks and a keyword-focused blog, enhances search engine rankings and website traffic. Leveraging an email database of over 60,000 subscribers aids in product promotion, and an active social media presence fosters a loyal customer community.
Efficient daily operations managed by an experienced team, including a full-time Amazon manager and two in-house sales managers, form a significant benefit for potential buyers. The current owners focus primarily on inventory management and overseeing the proficient team.

Medical Compression & Women’s Shapewear Brand – eCommerce & Wholesale Channels – 70% Repeat Wholesale Orders – 31% Repeat Retail Orders,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://thesmblist.com/medical-compression-womens-shapewear-brand-ecommerce-wholesale-channels-70-repeat-wholesale-orders-31-repeat-retail-orders/,N/A,thesmblist.com,"Website Closers® presents a highly regarded eCommerce leader in the shapewear and compression garment industry, that has, due to a rise of interest in the North American region, found a particularly strong foothold in the United States.
Shapewear products have grown progressively more popular due to their ability to enhance body shape and provide a slimming effect, giving the wearer’s body a more streamlined silhouette that’s desirable among many consumers. Compression garments, meanwhile, are typically used post-surgery to expedite the healing process by providing valuable support to the treated area.
The specific combination of markets that the company serves has made them ideal for customers undergoing cosmetic procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts, liposuction, or tummy tucks, with their products helping to reduce swelling and promote faster recovery.
The company has readily tackled the surge of demand in their industry, growing into the most prominent wholesaler in the US. Though they own most of the brands they sell, they also have exclusive distribution agreements with various other popular brands, giving them a competitive edge in the market. As they source their products from Latin America, a region where specialized compression garments and shapewear are prevalent, they can successfully offer their customers authentic and high-quality products.
Their success can be further noted by their marvelous reputation on popular online platforms like Amazon, where they regularly enjoy top ranking in the Shapewear-Bodysuits category through the trust and credibility they’ve built up around their products.
Their manufacturers are primarily based in Colombia and Mexico, with each manufacturing plant having a specialized team. Management has negotiated exclusive safety stock with them, and over the past decade, many of their products have been exclusively manufactured for the company. They own the largest brands and distribute and sell some others, with many also having exclusivity contracts.
The company places their orders on a weekly and monthly basis, with favorable net 45 to 60-day payment terms.
They maintain over 60 days of sales inventory in their domestic warehouse and have the same amount hosted at Amazon FBA facilities. They also offer DropShipping for their wholesale customers, which cuts down on fulfillment costs.
They have a total of 7,000 SKUs spread out across roughly 500 products, with no concentration on any specific product. Their top 10 products are responsible for 40% of units sold, while the top 100 accounts for 83%.
The company’s wholesale channel accounts for 60% of their total revenue, with 930 active wholesale customers spending an average of $900 per order and providing the brand with both a 70% repeat purchase rate and a YOY growth rate of 15%. The remaining 40% is generated through retail, which is divided between their Amazon storefront, their company websites, Walmart, and eBay, with Amazon generating most of these sales at 67%. They have had a fantastic track record for 6 years, with each year seeing improved margins.
The brand sees little seasonality in their sales, as there is year-round demand for their products. They do, however, see a peak during March and April, which are months when plastic and cosmetic surgeries are most in demand. Management increased inventory levels by around 20% during this period.
Their digital marketing strategy consists of various tactics that differ across channels and has proven effective enough to attract over 2 million impressions every month. They use SEO, email and SMS marketing, influencers, social media ads, and PPC on search engines for their websites, and SEO, PPC, product placement, and special deals for Amazon.
They use many of the above strategies for their wholesale channels, which they complement with attending trade shows and outreach from a team of sales reps.
The company has 5 shareholders who work in the following capacities:
Nearly all the brand’s operations, logistics, app development, IMS, marketing, and content are performed in-house by various departments. Their team is incredibly seasoned and talented at what they do, with each department head having worked for the brand for an average of 6 years. They boast a great company culture, which is reflected in their exceedingly low turnover of critical personnel by industry standards.
The future for the shapewear and compression garment industry is bright, with the market poised to see significant growth and demand throughout the upcoming years. The products in this industry are progressively becoming more comfortable, versatile, and aesthetically appealing as fabric technology, design innovation, and focus on health & wellness marches on, fueling interest and sales.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"$ 27,765,000","$ 48,845,843","$ 5,841,837",N/A,N/A,01/19/2024,,,https://www.websiteclosers.com/businesses/medical-compression-women-s-shapewear-brand-ecommerce-wholesale-channels-70-repeat-wholesale-orders-31-repeat-retail-orders/108512
